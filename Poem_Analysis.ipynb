        "### 1. Sylvia Plath \n",
        "\n",
        "An American poet, novelist, and short-story writer. She is credited with advancing the genre of confessional poetry and is best known for two of her published collections, The Colossus and Other Poems (1960) and Ariel (1965), as well as The Bell Jar, a semi-autobiographical novel published shortly before her death in 1963. \n",
        "\n",
        "***Sylvia Plath's early poems exhibit what became her typical imagery, using personal and nature-based depictions featuring, for example, the moon, blood, hospitals, fetuses, and skulls.*** Plath's landscape poetry, which she wrote throughout her life, has been described as **\"a rich and important area of her work that is often overlooked, some of the best of which was written about the Yorkshire moors\".** \n",
        "\n",
        "After 1960 her work moved into a more surreal landscape darkened by a sense of imprisonment and looming death, overshadowed by her father. The Colossus is shot through with themes of death, redemption and resurrection. After her husband left, Plath produced, in less than two months, the 40 poems of rage, despair, love, and vengeance on which her reputation mostly rests.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Some in the feminist movement saw Plath as speaking for their experience, as a \"symbol of blighted female genius\".\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Rabindranath Tagore\n",
        "\n",
        "A Indian Bengali polymath who worked as a poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter.He reshaped Bengali literature and music as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the \"profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful\" poetry of Gitanjali, he became in 1913 the first non-European and the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n",
        "\n",
        "His verse (topic), short stories, and novels **were acclaimed their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation.** His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's \"Jana Gana Mana\" and Bangladesh's \"Amar Shonar Bangla\". The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work.\n",
        "\n",
        "His poems took on a lyrical voice of the moner manush - \"man within the heart\" and Tagore's \"life force of his deep recesses\", or meditating upon the jeevan devata—the demiurge or the \"living God within\".This figure connected with divinity through appeal to nature and the emotional interplay of human drama.

The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.

I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.      \"],\n",

My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.</td>\n",

The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.</td>\n",

Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.</td>\n",

My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You\\\\u2014\\\\u2014   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I\\'m finally through.  The black telephone\\'s off at the root,  The voices just can\\'t worm through.   If I\\'ve killed one man, I\\'ve killed two\\\\u2014-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There\\'s a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I\\'m through.     \",\\n    \"Poet\": \"Sylvia Plath\",\\n    \"documents_cleaned\": \"do  more  black shoe lived like foot thirty years  poor white  barely daring breathe

The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I\\'m a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip\\'s funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it\\'s pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon\\'s crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister\\'s birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty

\"Poem\": \"The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage \\\\u2014\\\\u2014 My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn\\'t want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free \\\\u2014\\\\u2014 The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.     \",\\n    \"Poet\": \"Sylvia Plath\",\\n    \"documents_cleaned\": \"tulips excitable  winter here

But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king\\'s palace is.      It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.      There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.      Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the barber in the story lives.      But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.

In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day\\'s caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment\\'s whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth\\'s slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time\\'s waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind\\'s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night\\'s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket\\'s chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \\\\\"What is thy secret?\\\\\" \\\\\"It is myself,\\\\\" says the lotus, \\\\\"Steal it and I disappear!\\\\\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine\\'s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, \\\\u2014 a phantasy in time\\'s dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life\\'s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn\\\\u2014the many-coloured flower\\\\u2014fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life\\'s play is swift, Life\\'s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool\\'s buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth\\'s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth\\'s green, the wind between them sighs, \\\\\"Alas.\\\\\" Day\\'s pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror\\'s triumph children build their doll\\'s house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame\\'s kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter\\'s door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man\\'s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan\\'s ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday\\'s love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \\\\\"I shall ever remember thee,\\\\\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth\\'s gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth\\'s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air\\'s invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth\\'s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,\\\\u2014 It is thine.  The picture\\\\u2014a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \\\\\"Enough,\\\\\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,\\\\u2014 it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \\\\\"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\\\\\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master\\'s breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower\\'s speechless secrets, the clouds\\' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \\\\\"Tell me that you are only for me.\\\\\" \\\\\"Yes,\\\\\" she answers, \\\\\"And also only for that nameless flower.\\\\\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another\\'s lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King\\'s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill\\'s own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day\\'s empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning\\'s festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day\\'s faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \\\\\"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\\\\\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life\\'s strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life\\'s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun\\'s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \\\\\"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\\\\\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God\\'s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart\\'s pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun\\'s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart\\'spain at love\\'s sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring\\'s call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life\\'s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life\\'s story is woven with the threads of life\\'s ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death\\'s barren beach,\\\\u2014 a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word\\'s gate, love\\'s light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life\\'s aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life\\'s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day\\'s end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love\\'s gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \\\\\"Thy days are ended,\\\\\" let me say to him, \\\\\"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\\\\\" He will ask, \\\\\"Will thy songs remain?\\\\\" I shall say, \\\\\"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\\\\\"  \\\\\"Let me light my lamp,\\\\\" say the star, \\'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\\\\\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.      \",\\n    \"Poet\": \"Rabindranath Tagore\",\\n    \"documents_cleaned\": \"fancies fireflies    specks living light twinkling dark  voice wayside pansies  attract careless glance

Often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times.      You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.      Father always plays at making books.      If ever I go to play in father\\'s room, you come and call me, \\\\\"What a naughty child!\\\\\"      If I make the slightest noise you say, \\\\\"Don\\'t you see that father\\'s at his work?\\\\\"      What\\'s the fun of always writing and writing?      When I take up father\\'s pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me then, mother?      You never say a word when father writes.      When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don\\'t seem to mind at all.      But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, \\\\\"Child, how troublesome you are!\\\\\"      What do you think of father\\'s spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all

One year in every ten   I manage it——     A sort of walking miracle, my skin   Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   My right foot     A paperweight,   My face a featureless, fine   Jew linen.     Peel off the napkin   0 my enemy.   Do I terrify?——     The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   The sour breath   Will vanish in a day.     Soon, soon the flesh   The grave cave ate will be   At home on me     And I a smiling woman.   I am only thirty.   And like the cat I have nine times to die.     This is Number Three.   What a trash   To annihilate each decade.     What a million filaments.   The peanut-crunching crowd   Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot   The big strip tease.   Gentlemen, ladies     These are my hands   My knees.   I may be skin and bone,     Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   The first time it happened I was ten.   It was an accident.     The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.     \n",

Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.      \n",

            "Poem: The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.     \n",

In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.      \n",

            "Poem: Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me—      \"We play from the time we wake till the day ends.      We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to get up to you ?\"      They answer, \"Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.\"      \"My mother is waiting for me at home, \"I say, \"How can I leave her and come?\"      Then they smile and float away.      But I know a nicer game than that, mother.      I shall be the cloud and you the moon.      I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.      The folk who live in the waves call out to me—      \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"      They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"      I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the evening*— how can I leave her and go?\"      They smile, dance and pass by.      But I know a better game than that.      I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.      I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter.      And no one in the world will know where we both are.*This word \"evening\" is an editing of the original post. Across the web, it seems, it was mistakenly replaced with \"everything,\" but this is not the case on p.28 of Tagore's own translation of his book The Crescent Moon - Child-Poems.      \n",

Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him In the sight and touch of my beloved? This 'I' beyond self I found On the shores of the shining sea. Therefore I know This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds. Losing myself, I find him Beyond the borders of time and space. Through the Ages I come to know his Shining Self In the life of the seeker, In the voice of the poet. From the dark clouds pour the rains. I sit and think: Bearing so many forms, so many names, I come down, crossing the threshold Of countless births and deaths. The Supreme undivided, complete in himself, Embracing past and present, Dwells in Man. Within Him I shall find myself - The 'I' that reaches everywhere.      \n",

            "Poem: You say that father write a lot of books, but what he writes I don't understand.      He was reading to you all evening, but could you really make out what he meant?      What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?      Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?      Has he forgotten them all?      Often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times.      You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.      Father always plays at making books.      If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me, \"What a naughty child!\"      If I make the slightest noise you say, \"Don't you see that father's at his work?\"      What's the fun of always writing and writing?      When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me then, mother?      You never say a word when father writes.      When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all.      But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, \"Child, how troublesome you are!\"      What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over both sides?(This poem is from 'The Crescent Moon' by Tagore)      \n",

            "Poem: Time is endless in thy hands, my lord.  There is none to count thy minutes.   Days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers.  Thou knowest how to wait.   Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.   We have no time to lose,  and having no time we must scramble for a chance.  We are too poor to be late.   And thus it is that time goes by  while I give it to every querulous man who claims it,  and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.   At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut;  but I find that yet there is time.     \n",

            "Poem: You do not do, you do not do  Any more, black shoe  In which I have lived like a foot  For thirty years, poor and white,  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.  You died before I had time—-  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,  Ghastly statue with one gray toe  Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic  Where it pours bean green over blue  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.  I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.     \n",

The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.      But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.      It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.      There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.      Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the barber in the story lives.      But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.

Thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope. Thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own. O Far-to-seek, O the keen call of thy flute! I forget, I ever forget, that I know not the way, that I have not the winged horse.  I am listless, I am a wanderer in my heart. In the sunny haze of the languid hours, what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky! O Farthest end, O the keen call of thy flute!

Sun struck the water like a damnation. No pit of shadow to crawl into, And his blood beating the old tattoo I am, I am, I am. Children Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave. A mongrel working his legs to a gallop Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.  He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold, His body beached with the sea's garbage, A machine to breathe and beat forever. Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber. The words in his book wormed off the pages. Everything glittered like blank paper.  Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage. He heard when he walked into the water  The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.     \n",

One year in every ten   I manage it——     A sort of walking miracle, my skin   Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   My right foot     A paperweight,   My face a featureless, fine   Jew linen.     Peel off the napkin   0 my enemy.   Do I terrify?——     The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   The sour breath   Will vanish in a day.     Soon, soon the flesh   The grave cave ate will be   At home on me     And I a smiling woman.   I am only thirty.   And like the cat I have nine times to die.     This is Number Three.   What a trash   To annihilate each decade.     What a million filaments.   The peanut-crunching crowd   Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot   The big strip tease.   Gentlemen, ladies     These are my hands   My knees.   I may be skin and bone,     Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   The first time it happened I was ten.   It was an accident.     The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.     \n",

            "Poem: On this bald hill the new year hones its edge.Faceless and pale as chinaThe round sky goes on minding its business.Your absence is inconspicuous;Nobody can tell what I lack.Gulls have threaded the river's mud bed backTo this crest of grass.  Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.      \n",

            "Poem: The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.     \n",

            "Poem: Fireflies\n",
            "Poem: My fancies are fireflies, —  Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.  he voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.  In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.      \n",

            "Poem: Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me—      \"We play from the time we wake till the day ends.      We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to get up to you ?\"      They answer, \"Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.\"      \"My mother is waiting for me at home, \"I say, \"How can I leave her and come?\"      Then they smile and float away.      But I know a nicer game than that, mother.      I shall be the cloud and you the moon.      I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.      The folk who live in the waves call out to me—      \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"      They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"      I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the evening*— how can I leave her and go?\"      They smile, dance and pass by.      But I know a better game than that.      I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.      I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter.      And no one in the world will know where we both are.*This word \"evening\" is an editing of the original post. Across the web, it seems, it was mistakenly replaced with \"everything,\" but this is not the case on p.28 of Tagore's own translation of his book The Crescent Moon - Child-Poems.      \n",

Therefore I know This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds. Losing myself, I find him Beyond the borders of time and space. Through the Ages I come to know his Shining Self In the life of the seeker, In the voice of the poet. From the dark clouds pour the rains. I sit and think: Bearing so many forms, so many names, I come down, crossing the threshold Of countless births and deaths.

            "Poem: You say that father write a lot of books, but what he writes I don't understand.      He was reading to you all evening, but could you really make out what he meant?      What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?      Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?      Has he forgotten them all?      Often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times.      You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.      Father always plays at making books.      If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me, \"What a naughty child!\"      If I make the slightest noise you say, \"Don't you see that father's at his work?\"      What's the fun of always writing and writing?      When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me then, mother?      You never say a word when father writes.      When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all.      But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, \"Child, how troublesome you are!\"      What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over both sides?(This poem is from 'The Crescent Moon' by Tagore)      \n",

By what dim shore of the ink-black river,  by what far edge of the frowning forest,  through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading  thy course to come to me, my friend?      \n",

Thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower.   We have no time to lose,  and having no time we must scramble for a chance.  We are too poor to be late.   And thus it is that time goes by  while I give it to every querulous man who claims it,  and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last.   At the end of the day I hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut;  but I find that yet there is time.     \n",

            "Poem: You do not do, you do not do  Any more, black shoe  In which I have lived like a foot  For thirty years, poor and white,  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.  You died before I had time—-  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,  Ghastly statue with one gray toe  Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic  Where it pours bean green over blue  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.  I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.     \n",

The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.      But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.      It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.      There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.      Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the barber in the story lives.      But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.

Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.      \n",

Ever and again I open my door and look out on  the darkness, my friend!   I can see nothing before me.  I wonder where lies thy path!   By what dim shore of the ink-black river,  by what far edge of the frowning forest,  through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading  thy course to come to me, my friend?      \n",

            "Poem: Daddy\n",
            "Poem: You do not do, you do not do  Any more, black shoe  In which I have lived like a foot  For thirty years, poor and white,  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.  You died before I had time—-  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,  Ghastly statue with one gray toe  Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic  Where it pours bean green over blue  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.  I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.     \n",

            "Poem:  I have done it again.   One year in every ten   I manage it——     A sort of walking miracle, my skin   Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   My right foot     A paperweight,   My face a featureless, fine   Jew linen.     Peel off the napkin   0 my enemy.   Do I terrify?——     The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   The sour breath   Will vanish in a day.     Soon, soon the flesh   The grave cave ate will be   At home on me     And I a smiling woman.   I am only thirty.   And like the cat I have nine times to die.     This is Number Three.   What a trash   To annihilate each decade.     What a million filaments.   The peanut-crunching crowd   Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot   The big strip tease.   Gentlemen, ladies     These are my hands   My knees.   I may be skin and bone,     Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   The first time it happened I was ten.   It was an accident.     The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.     \n",

Mother Medea in a green smock  Moves humbly as any housewife through  Her ruined apartments, taking stock  Of charred shoes, the sodden upholstery:  Cheated of the pyre and the rack,  The crowd sucks her last tear and turns away.      \n",

            "Poem: Fireflies\n",
            "Poem: My fancies are fireflies, —  Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.  he voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.  In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.      \n",

            "Poem: Tulips\n",
            "Poem: The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.     \n",

Through the Ages I come to know his Shining Self In the life of the seeker, In the voice of the poet. From the dark clouds pour the rains. I sit and think: Bearing so many forms, so many names, I come down, crossing the threshold Of countless births and deaths.

The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.      But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.

There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.

What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?      Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?      Has he forgotten them all?      Often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times.      You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.      Father always plays at making books.      If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me, \"What a naughty child!\"      If I make the slightest noise you say, \"Don't you see that father's at his work?\"      What's the fun of always writing and writing?      When I take up father's pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does,-a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,-why do you get cross with me then, mother?      You never say a word when father writes.      When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all.      But if I take only one sheet to make a boat with, you say, \"Child, how troublesome you are!\"      What do you think of father's spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over both sides?(This poem is from 'The Crescent Moon' by Tagore)      \n",

But I know a nicer game than that, mother.      I shall be the cloud and you the moon.      I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.      The folk who live in the waves call out to me—      \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"      They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"      I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the evening*— how can I leave her and go?\"      They smile, dance and pass by.

And no one in the world will know where we both are.*This word \"evening\" is an editing of the original post. Across the web, it seems, it was mistakenly replaced with \"everything,\" but this is not the case on p.28 of Tagore's own translation of his book The Crescent Moon - Child-Poems.      \n",

Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.      \n",

Sun struck the water like a damnation. No pit of shadow to crawl into, And his blood beating the old tattoo I am, I am, I am. Children Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave. A mongrel working his legs to a gallop Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.  He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold, His body beached with the sea's garbage, A machine to breathe and beat forever. Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber. The words in his book wormed off the pages. Everything glittered like blank paper.  Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage. He heard when he walked into the water  The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.     \n",

            "Poem: You do not do, you do not do  Any more, black shoe  In which I have lived like a foot  For thirty years, poor and white,  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.  You died before I had time—-  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,  Ghastly statue with one gray toe  Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic  Where it pours bean green over blue  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.  I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.     \n",

            "Poem:  I have done it again.   One year in every ten   I manage it——     A sort of walking miracle, my skin   Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   My right foot     A paperweight,   My face a featureless, fine   Jew linen.     Peel off the napkin   0 my enemy.   Do I terrify?——     The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   The sour breath   Will vanish in a day.     Soon, soon the flesh   The grave cave ate will be   At home on me     And I a smiling woman.   I am only thirty.   And like the cat I have nine times to die.     This is Number Three.   What a trash   To annihilate each decade.     What a million filaments.   The peanut-crunching crowd   Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot   The big strip tease.   Gentlemen, ladies     These are my hands   My knees.   I may be skin and bone,     Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   The first time it happened I was ten.   It was an accident.     The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.     \n",

            "Poem: Fireflies\n",
            "Poem: My fancies are fireflies, —  Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.  he voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.  In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.      \n",

            "Poem: The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.     \n",

Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him In the sight and touch of my beloved? This 'I' beyond self I found On the shores of the shining sea. Therefore I know This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds. Losing myself, I find him Beyond the borders of time and space. Through the Ages I come to know his Shining Self In the life of the seeker, In the voice of the poet. From the dark clouds pour the rains. I sit and think: Bearing so many forms, so many names, I come down, crossing the threshold Of countless births and deaths. The Supreme undivided, complete in himself, Embracing past and present, Dwells in Man. Within Him I shall find myself - The 'I' that reaches everywhere.      \n",

There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.

What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?      Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?

The folk who live in the waves call out to me—      \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"      They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"      I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the evening*— how can I leave her and go?\"      They smile, dance and pass by.

Across the web, it seems, it was mistakenly replaced with \"everything,\" but this is not the case on p.28 of Tagore's own translation of his book The Crescent Moon - Child-Poems.      \n",

            "Poem: On this bald hill the new year hones its edge.Faceless and pale as chinaThe round sky goes on minding its business.Your absence is inconspicuous;Nobody can tell what I lack.Gulls have threaded the river's mud bed backTo this crest of grass.  Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.      \n",

            "Poem: Behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled On the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats, Gas tanks, factory stacks- that landscape Of imperfections his bowels were part of- Rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught. Sun struck the water like a damnation. No pit of shadow to crawl into, And his blood beating the old tattoo I am, I am, I am. Children Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave. A mongrel working his legs to a gallop Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.  He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold, His body beached with the sea's garbage, A machine to breathe and beat forever. Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber. The words in his book wormed off the pages. Everything glittered like blank paper.  Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage. He heard when he walked into the water  The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.     \n",

            "Poem: You do not do, you do not do  Any more, black shoe  In which I have lived like a foot  For thirty years, poor and white,  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.  You died before I had time—-  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,  Ghastly statue with one gray toe  Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic  Where it pours bean green over blue  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.  I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.     \n",

            "Poem:  I have done it again.   One year in every ten   I manage it——     A sort of walking miracle, my skin   Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   My right foot     A paperweight,   My face a featureless, fine   Jew linen.     Peel off the napkin   0 my enemy.   Do I terrify?——     The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   The sour breath   Will vanish in a day.     Soon, soon the flesh   The grave cave ate will be   At home on me     And I a smiling woman.   I am only thirty.   And like the cat I have nine times to die.     This is Number Three.   What a trash   To annihilate each decade.     What a million filaments.   The peanut-crunching crowd   Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot   The big strip tease.   Gentlemen, ladies     These are my hands   My knees.   I may be skin and bone,     Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   The first time it happened I was ten.   It was an accident.     The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.     \n",

            "Poem: Fireflies\n",
            "Poem: My fancies are fireflies, —  Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.  he voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.  In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.      \n",

            "Poem: Tulips\n",
            "Poem: The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.     \n",

Why then in a flood of joy do I feel him In the sight and touch of my beloved? This 'I' beyond self I found On the shores of the shining sea. Therefore I know This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds. Losing myself, I find him Beyond the borders of time and space. Through the Ages I come to know his Shining Self In the life of the seeker, In the voice of the poet. From the dark clouds pour the rains. I sit and think: Bearing so many forms, so many names, I come down, crossing the threshold Of countless births and deaths. The Supreme undivided, complete in himself, Embracing past and present, Dwells in Man. Within Him I shall find myself - The 'I' that reaches everywhere.      \n",

The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.      But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.      It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.      There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.

What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?      Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?      Has he forgotten them all?      Often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times.      You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.      Father always plays at making books.      If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me, \"What a naughty child!\"      If I make the slightest noise you say, \"Don't you see that father's at his work?\"      What's the fun of always writing and writing?

When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all.

            "Poem: Mother, the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me—      \"We play from the time we wake till the day ends.      We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to get up to you ?\"      They answer, \"Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.\"      \"My mother is waiting for me at home, \"I say, \"How can I leave her and come?\"      Then they smile and float away.      But I know a nicer game than that, mother.      I shall be the cloud and you the moon.      I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.      The folk who live in the waves call out to me—      \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"      They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"      I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the evening*— how can I leave her and go?\"      They smile, dance and pass by.      But I know a better game than that.      I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.      I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter.      And no one in the world will know where we both are.*This word \"evening\" is an editing of the original post. Across the web, it seems, it was mistakenly replaced with \"everything,\" but this is not the case on p.28 of Tagore's own translation of his book The Crescent Moon - Child-Poems.      \n",

            "Poem:  The womb Rattles its pod, the moon Discharges itself from the tree with nowhere to go. My landscape is a hand with no lines, The roads bunched to a knot, The knot myself, Myself the rose you acheive—- This body, This ivory Ungodly as a child's shriek. Spiderlike, I spin mirrors, Loyal to my image, Uttering nothing but blood—- Taste it, dark red! And my forest My funeral, And this hill and this Gleaming with the mouths of corpses.      \n",

God's lioness, How one we grow, Pivot of heels and knees! —-The furrow  Splits and passes, sister to The brown arc Of the neck I cannot catch,  Nigger-eye Berries cast dark Hooks —-  Black sweet blood mouthfuls, Shadows. Something else  Hauls me through air —- Thighs, hair; Flakes from my heels.  White Godiva, I unpeel —- Dead hands, dead stringencies.  And now I Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas.

            "Poem: On this bald hill the new year hones its edge.Faceless and pale as chinaThe round sky goes on minding its business.Your absence is inconspicuous;Nobody can tell what I lack.Gulls have threaded the river's mud bed backTo this crest of grass.  Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.      \n",

            "Poem: Behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled On the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats, Gas tanks, factory stacks- that landscape Of imperfections his bowels were part of- Rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught. Sun struck the water like a damnation. No pit of shadow to crawl into, And his blood beating the old tattoo I am, I am, I am. Children Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave. A mongrel working his legs to a gallop Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.  He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold, His body beached with the sea's garbage, A machine to breathe and beat forever. Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber. The words in his book wormed off the pages. Everything glittered like blank paper.  Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage. He heard when he walked into the water  The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.     \n",

            "Poem: You do not do, you do not do  Any more, black shoe  In which I have lived like a foot  For thirty years, poor and white,  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.  You died before I had time—-  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,  Ghastly statue with one gray toe  Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic  Where it pours bean green over blue  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.  I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.     \n",

            "Poem:  I have done it again.   One year in every ten   I manage it——     A sort of walking miracle, my skin   Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   My right foot     A paperweight,   My face a featureless, fine   Jew linen.     Peel off the napkin   0 my enemy.   Do I terrify?——     The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   The sour breath   Will vanish in a day.     Soon, soon the flesh   The grave cave ate will be   At home on me     And I a smiling woman.   I am only thirty.   And like the cat I have nine times to die.     This is Number Three.   What a trash   To annihilate each decade.     What a million filaments.   The peanut-crunching crowd   Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot   The big strip tease.   Gentlemen, ladies     These are my hands   My knees.   I may be skin and bone,     Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   The first time it happened I was ten.   It was an accident.     The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.     \n",

            "Poem: Fireflies\n",
            "Poem: My fancies are fireflies, —  Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.  he voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.  In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.      \n",

            "Poem: Tulips\n",
            "Poem: The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.     \n",

Therefore I know This 'I' is not imprisoned within my bounds. Losing myself, I find him Beyond the borders of time and space. Through the Ages I come to know his Shining Self In the life of the seeker, In the voice of the poet. From the dark clouds pour the rains. I sit and think: Bearing so many forms, so many names, I come down, crossing the threshold Of countless births and deaths. The Supreme undivided, complete in himself, Embracing past and present, Dwells in Man. Within Him I shall find myself - The 'I' that reaches everywhere.      \n",

The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.      But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.

There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.      Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the barber in the story lives.      But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.

What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?      Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?      Has he forgotten them all?      Often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times.      You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.      Father always plays at making books.

We play with the golden dawn, we play with the silver moon.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to get up to you ?\"      They answer, \"Come to the edge of the earth, lift up your hands to the sky, and you will be taken up into the clouds.\"      \"My mother is waiting for me at home, \"I say, \"How can I leave her and come?\"      Then they smile and float away.      But I know a nicer game than that, mother.      I shall be the cloud and you the moon.      I shall cover you with both my hands, and our house-top will be the blue sky.      The folk who live in the waves call out to me—      \"We sing from morning till night; on and on we travel and know not where we pass.\"      I ask, \"But how am I to join you?\"      They tell me, \"Come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut, and you will be carried out upon the waves.\"      I say, \"My mother always wants me at home in the evening*— how can I leave her and go?\"      They smile, dance and pass by.      But I know a better game than that.      I will be the waves and you will be a strange shore.      I shall roll on and on and on, and break upon your lap with laughter.      And no one in the world will know where we both are.*This word \"evening\" is an editing of the original post. Across the web, it seems, it was mistakenly replaced with \"everything,\" but this is not the case on p.28 of Tagore's own translation of his book The Crescent Moon - Child-Poems.      \n",

with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark

secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the

the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches

to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change',\n",

grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind

for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine flower have pity for the worm it is not a bee its love is a blunder and a burden with the ruins of terror s triumph children build their doll s house the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the

depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a

pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of

your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change\n",

the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change\n",

freed from the bond of earth s slumber rushes into numberless leaves and dances in the air for a day my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time s waves when my works havy with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance and therefore you may remember them leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden but keep my song april like a child writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers wipes them away and forgets memory the priestess kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated in the mountain stillness surges up to explore its own height in the lake movement stands still to contemplate its own depth the departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket s chirp bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible there smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine

the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well wisher we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live your careless gifts of a moment like the meteors of an autumn night catch fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence

gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance and therefore you may remember them leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden but keep my song april like a child writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers wipes them away and forgets memory the priestess kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated in the mountain stillness surges up to explore its own height in the lake movement stands still to contemplate its own depth the departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the

stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible there smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine flower have pity for the worm it is not a bee its love is a blunder and a burden with the ruins of terror s triumph children build their doll s house the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well wisher we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live your careless gifts of a moment like the meteors of an autumn night catch fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change\n",

nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person tmost are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and tmostfore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open wmost thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gatmostd and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from wmost i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and tmostfore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change\n",

            "my fancies are fireflies — specks of living light twinkling in the dark he voice of wayside pansies that do not attract the careless glance murmurs in these desultory lines in the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day s caravan spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future but for the moment s whim joy freed from the bond of earth s slumber rushes into numberless leaves and dances in the air for a day my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time s waves when my works havy with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance and tmostfore you may remember them leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden but keep my song april like a child writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers wipes them away and forgets memory the priestess kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated in the mountain stillness surges up to explore its own height in the lake movement stands still to contemplate its own depth the departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket s chirp bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible tmost smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine flower have pity for the worm it is not a bee its love is a blunder and a burden with the ruins of terror s triumph children build their doll s house the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well wisher we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live your careless gifts of a moment like the meteors of an autumn night catch fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth tmost to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for tmost it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee tmost is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is tmost to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely

whim joy freed from the bond of earth s slumber rushes into numberless leaves and dances in the air for a day my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time s waves when my works havy with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance and tmostfore you may remember them leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden but keep my song april like a child writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers wipes them away and forgets memory the priestess kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated in the mountain stillness surges up to explore its own height in the lake movement stands still to contemplate its own depth the departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket s chirp bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible tmost smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine flower have pity for the worm it is not a bee its love is a blunder and a burden with the ruins of terror s triumph children build their doll s house the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well wisher we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live your careless gifts of a moment like the meteors of an autumn night catch fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth tmost to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for tmost it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee tmost is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is tmost to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person tmost are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and tmostfore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open wmost thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gatmostd and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from wmost i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and tmostfore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change',\n",

sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of

flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth tmost to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable

to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is tmost to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous

the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gatmostd and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from wmost i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and tmostfore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change',\n",

moment s whim joy freed from the bond of earth s slumber rushes into numberless leaves and dances in the air for a day my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time s waves when my works havy with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined

of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a

departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket s chirp bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible there smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the

the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches

to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted

for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful

her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice

buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches

fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth tmost to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for tmost it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee tmost is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is tmost to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person tmost are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and tmostfore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open wmost thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gatmostd and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from wmost i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and tmostfore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change',\n",

together with glue and then i knew what to do i made a model of you a man in black with a meinkampf look and a love of the rack and the screw and i said i do i do so daddy i am finally through the black telephone s off at the root the voices just cannot worm through if i have killed one man i have killed two— the vampire who said he was you and drank my blood for a year seven years if you want to know daddy you can lie back now there is a stake in your fat black heart and the villagers never liked you they are dancing and stamping on you they always knew it was you daddy daddy you bastard i am through', 'behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled on the public grills and the ochreous salt flats gas tanks factory stacks that landscape of imperfections his bowels were part of rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught sun struck the water like a damnation no pit of shadow to crawl into and his blood beating the old tattoo i am i am i am children were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift raveled wind ripped from the crest of the wave a mongrel working his legs to a gallop hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit he smoldered as if stone deaf blindfold his body beached with the sea s garbage a machine to breathe and beat forever flies filing in through a dead skate s eyehole buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber the words in his book wormed off the pages everything glittered like blank paper everything shrank in the sun s corrosive ray but egg rock on the blue wastage he heard when he walked into the water the forgetful surf creaming on those ledges', 'i have done it again one year in every ten i manage it—— a sort of walking miracle my skin bright as a nazi lampshade my right foot a paperweight my face a featureless fine jew linen peel off the napkin 0 my enemy do i terrify —— the nose the eye pits the full set of teeth the sour breath will vanish in a day soon soon the flesh the grave cave ate will be at home on me and i a smiling woman i am only thirty and like the cat i have nine times to die this is number three what a trash to annihilate each decade what a million filaments the peanut crunching crowd shoves in to see them unwrap me hand and foot the big strip tease gentlemen ladies these are my hands my knees i may be skin and bone nevertheless i am the same identical woman the first time it happened i was ten it was an accident the second time i meant to last it out and not come back at all i rocked shut as a seashell they had to call and call and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls dying is an art like everything else i do it exceptionally well i do it so it feels like hell i do it so it feels real i guess you could say i have a call it is easy enough to do it in a cell it is easy enough to do it and stay put it is the theatrical comeback in broad day to the same place the same face the same brute amused shout a miracle that knocks me out there is a charge for the eyeing of my scars there is a charge for the hearing of my heart—— it really goes and there is a charge a very large charge for a word or a touch or a bit of blood or a piece of my hair or my clothes so so herr doktor so herr enemy i am your opus i am your valuable the pure gold baby that melts to a shriek i turn and burn do not think i underestimate your great concern ash ash — you poke and stir flesh bone there is nothing there—— a cake of soap a wedding ring a gold filling herr god herr lucifer beware beware out of the ash i rise with my red hair and i eat men like air', 'on this bald hill the new year hones its edge faceless and pale as chinathe round sky goes on minding its business your absence is inconspicuous nobody can tell what i lack gulls have threaded the river s mud bed backto this crest of grass inland they argue settling and stirring like blown paperor the hands of an invalid the wansun manages to strike such tin glintsfrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceand brim the city melts like sugar a crocodile of small girlsknotting and stopping ill assorted in blue uniforms opens to swallow me i am a stone a stick one child drops a barrette of pink plastic none of them seem to notice their shrill gravelly gossip s funneled off now silence after silence offers itself the wind stops my breath like a bandage southward over kentish town an ashen smudgeswaddles roof and tree it could be a snowfield or a cloudbank i suppose it is pointless to think of you at all already your doll grip let us go the tumulus even at noon guards its black shadow you know me less constant ghost of a leaf ghost of a bird i circle the writhen trees i am too happy these faithful dark boughed cypressesbrood rooted in their heaped losses your cry fades like the cry of a gnat i lose sight of you on your blind journey while the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsunspool and spend themselves my mind runs with them pooling in heel prints fumbling pebble and stem the day empties its imageslike a cup or a room the moon s crook whitens thin as the skin seaming a scar now on the nursery wall the blue night plants the little pale blue hillin your sister s birthday picture start to glow the orange pompons the egyptian papyruslight up each rabbit earedblue shrub behind the glassexhales an indigo nimbus a sort of cellophane balloon the old dregs the old difficulties take me to wife gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half light i enter the lit house', 'the tulips are too excitable it is winter here look how white everything is how quiet how snowed in i am learning peacefulness lying by myself quietly as the light lies on these white walls this bed these hands i am nobody i have nothing to do with explosions i have given my name and my day clothes up to the nurses and my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet cuff like an eye between two white lids that will not shut stupid pupil it has to take everything in the nurses pass and pass they are no trouble they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps doing things with their hands one just the same as another so it is impossible to tell how many there are my body is a pebble to them they tend it as water tends to the pebbles it must run over smoothing them gently they bring me numbness in their bright needles they bring me sleep now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage —— my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox my husband and child smiling out of the family photo their smiles catch onto my skin little smiling hooks i have let things slip a thirty year old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations scared and bare on the green plastic pillowed trolley i watched my teaset my bureaus of linen my books sink out of sight and the water went over my head i am a nun now i have never been so pure i did not want any flowers i only wanted to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty how free it is you have no idea how free —— the peacefulness is so big it dazes you and it asks nothing a name tag a few trinkets it is what the dead close on finally i imagine them shutting their mouths on it like a communion tablet the tulips are too red in the first place they hurt me even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe lightly through their white swaddlings like an awful baby their redness talks to my wound it corresponds they are subtle they seem to float though they weigh me down upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck nobody watched me before now i am watched the tulips turn to me and the window behind me where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins and i see myself flat ridiculous a cut paper shadow between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips and i have no face i have wanted to efface myself the vivid tulips eat my oxygen before they came the air was calm enough coming and going breath by breath without any fuss then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river snags and eddies round a sunken rust red engine they concentrate my attention that was happy playing and resting without committing itself the walls also seem to be warming themselves the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat and i am aware of my heart it opens and closes its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me the water i taste is warm and salty like the sea and comes from a country far away as health']\n"

dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day s caravan spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future but for the moment s whim joy freed from the bond of earth s slumber rushes into numberless leaves and dances in the air for a day my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time s waves when my works havy with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance and therefore you may remember them leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden but keep my song april like a child writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers wipes them away and forgets memory the priestess kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated in the mountain stillness surges up to explore its own height in the lake movement stands still to contemplate its own depth the departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket s chirp bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible there smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine flower have pity for the worm it is not a bee its love is a blunder and a burden with the ruins of terror s triumph children build their doll s house the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well wisher we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live your careless gifts of a moment like the meteors of an autumn night catch fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change\n",

farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change', 'you say that father write a lot of books but what he writes i do not understand he was reading to you all evening but could you really make out what he meant what nice stores mother you can tell us why cannot father write like that i wonder did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses has he forgotten them all often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times you wait and keep his dishes warm for him but he goes on writing and forgets father always plays at making books if ever i go to play in father s room you come and call me what a naughty child if i make the slightest noise you say do not you see that father s at his work what is the fun of always writing and writing when i take up father s pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does a b c d e f g h i why do you get cross with me then mother you never say a word when father writes when my father wastes such heaps of paper mother you do not seem to mind at all but if i take only one sheet to make a boat with you say child how troublesome you are what do you think of father s spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over both sides this poem is from the crescent moon by tagore', 'i wonder if i know him in whose speech is my voice in whose movement is my being whose skill is in my lines whose melody is in my songs in joy and sorrow i thought he was chained within me contained by tears and laughter work and play i thought he was my very self coming to an end with my death why then in a flood of joy do i feel him in the sight and touch of my beloved this i beyond self i found on the shores of the shining sea therefore i know this i is not imprisoned within my bounds losing myself i find him beyond the borders of time and space through the ages i come to know his shining self in the life of the seeker in the voice of the poet from the dark clouds pour the rains i sit and think bearing so many forms so many names i come down crossing the threshold of countless births and deaths the supreme undivided complete in himself embracing past and present dwells in man within him i shall find myself the i that reaches everywhere', 'art thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love my friend the sky groans like one in despair i have no sleep tonight ever and again i open my door and look out on the darkness my friend i can see nothing before me i wonder where lies thy path by what dim shore of the ink black river by what far edge of the frowning forest through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me my friend', 'where are those tears in your eyes my child how horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing you have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing is that why they call you dirty o fie would they dare to call the full moon dirty because it has smudged its face with ink for every little trifle they blame you my child they are ready to find fault for nothing you tore your clothes while playing is that why they call you untidy o fie what would they call an autumn morning that smiles through its ragged clouds take no heed of what they say to you my child they make a long list of your misdeeds everybody knows how you love sweet things is that why they call you greedy o fie what then would they call us who love you', 'time is endless in thy hands my lord there is none to count thy minutes days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers thou knowest how to wait thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower we have no time to lose and having no time we must scramble for a chance we are too poor to be late and thus it is that time goes by while i give it to every querulous man who claims it and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last at the end of the day i hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut but i find that yet there is time', 'i am restless i am athirst for far away things my soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim distance o great beyond o the keen call of thy flute i forget i ever forget that i have no wings to fly that i am bound in this spot evermore i am eager and wakeful i am a stranger in a strange land thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own o far to seek o the keen call of thy flute i forget i ever forget that i know not the way that i have not the winged horse i am listless i am a wanderer in my heart in the sunny haze of the languid hours what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky o farthest end o the keen call of thy flute i forget i ever forget that the gates are shut everywhere in the house where i dwell alone', 'mother the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me— we play from the time we wake till the day ends we play with the golden dawn we play with the silver moon i ask but how am i to get up to you they answer come to the edge of the earth lift up your hands to the sky and you will be taken up into the clouds my mother is waiting for me at home i say how can i leave her and come then they smile and float away but i know a nicer game than that mother i shall be the cloud and you the moon i shall cover you with both my hands and our house top will be the blue sky the folk who live in the waves call out to me— we sing from morning till night on and on we travel and know not where we pass i ask but how am i to join you they tell me come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut and you will be carried out upon the waves i say my mother always wants me at home in the evening — how can i leave her and go they smile dance and pass by but i know a better game than that i will be the waves and you will be a strange shore i shall roll on and on and on and break upon your lap with laughter and no one in the world will know where we both are this word evening is an editing of the original post across the web it seems it was mistakenly replaced with everything but this is not the case on p 28 of tagore s own translation of his book the crescent moon child poems']\n"

obscene an engine an engine chuffing me off like a jew a jew to dachau auschwitz belsen i began to talk like a jew i think i may well be a jew the snows of the tyrol the clear beer of vienna are not very pure or true with my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck and my taroc pack and my taroc pack i may be a bit of a jew i have always been scared of you with your luftwaffe your gobbledygoo and your neat mustache and your aryan eye bright blue panzer man panzer man o you—— not god but a swastika so black no sky could squeak through every woman adores a fascist the boot in the face the brute brute heart of a brute like you you stand at the blackboard daddy in the picture i have of you a cleft in your chin instead of your foot but no less a devil for that no not any less the black man who bit my pretty red heart in two i was ten when they buried you at twenty i tried to die and get back back back to you i thought even the bones would do but they pulled me out of the sack and they stuck me here with glue and then i knew what to do i made a model of you a man in black with a meinkampf look and a love of the rack and the screw and i said i do i do so daddy i am finally through the black telephone s off at the root the voices just cannot worm through if i have killed one man i have killed two— the vampire who said he was you and drank my blood for a year seven years if you want to know daddy you can lie back now there is a stake in your fat black heart and the villagers never liked you they are dancing and stamping on you they always knew it was you daddy daddy you bastard i am through', 'behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled on the public grills and the ochreous salt flats gas tanks factory stacks that landscape of imperfections his bowels were part of rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught sun struck the water like a damnation no pit of shadow to crawl into and his blood beating the old tattoo i am i am i am children were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift raveled wind ripped from the crest of the wave a mongrel working his legs to a gallop hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit he smoldered as if stone deaf blindfold his body beached with the sea s garbage a machine to breathe and beat forever flies filing in through a dead skate s eyehole buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber the words in his book wormed off the pages everything glittered like blank paper everything shrank in the sun s corrosive ray but egg rock on the blue wastage he heard when he walked into the water the forgetful surf creaming on those ledges', 'i have done it again one year in every ten i manage it—— a sort of walking miracle my skin bright as a nazi lampshade my right foot a paperweight my face a featureless fine jew linen peel off the napkin 0 my enemy do i terrify —— the nose the eye pits the full set of teeth the sour breath will vanish in a day soon soon the flesh the grave cave ate will be at home on me and i a smiling woman i am only thirty and like the cat i have nine times to die this is number three what a trash to annihilate each decade what a million filaments the peanut crunching crowd shoves in to see them unwrap me hand and foot the big strip tease gentlemen ladies these are my hands my knees i may be skin and bone nevertheless i am the same identical woman the first time it happened i was ten it was an accident the second time i meant to last it out and not come back at all i rocked shut as a seashell they had to call and call and pick the worms off me like sticky pearls dying is an art like everything else i do it exceptionally well i do it so it feels like hell i do it so it feels real i guess you could say i have a call it is easy enough to do it in a cell it is easy enough to do it and stay put it is the theatrical comeback in broad day to the same place the same face the same brute amused shout a miracle that knocks me out there is a charge for the eyeing of my scars there is a charge for the hearing of my heart—— it really goes and there is a charge a very large charge for a word or a touch or a bit of blood or a piece of my hair or my clothes so so herr doktor so herr enemy i am your opus i am your valuable the pure gold baby that melts to a shriek i turn and burn do not think i underestimate your great concern ash ash — you poke and stir flesh bone there is nothing there—— a cake of soap a wedding ring a gold filling herr god herr lucifer beware beware out of the ash i rise with my red hair and i eat men like air', 'on this bald hill the new year hones its edge faceless and pale as chinathe round sky goes on minding its business your absence is inconspicuous nobody can tell what i lack gulls have threaded the river s mud bed backto this crest of grass inland they argue settling and stirring like blown paperor the hands of an invalid the wansun manages to strike such tin glintsfrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceand brim the city melts like sugar a crocodile of small girlsknotting and stopping ill assorted in blue uniforms opens to swallow me i am a stone a stick one child drops a barrette of pink plastic none of them seem to notice their shrill gravelly gossip s funneled off now silence after silence offers itself the wind stops my breath like a bandage southward over kentish town an ashen smudgeswaddles roof and tree it could be a snowfield or a cloudbank i suppose it is pointless to think of you at all already your doll grip let us go the tumulus even at noon guards its black shadow you know me less constant ghost of a leaf ghost of a bird i circle the writhen trees i am too happy these faithful dark boughed cypressesbrood rooted in their heaped losses your cry fades like the cry of a gnat i lose sight of you on your blind journey while the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsunspool and spend themselves my mind runs with them pooling in heel prints fumbling pebble and stem the day empties its imageslike a cup or a room the moon s crook whitens thin as the skin seaming a scar now on the nursery wall the blue night plants the little pale blue hillin your sister s birthday picture start to glow the orange pompons the egyptian papyruslight up each rabbit earedblue shrub behind the glassexhales an indigo nimbus a sort of cellophane balloon the old dregs the old difficulties take me to wife gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half light i enter the lit house', 'the tulips are too excitable it is winter here look how white everything is how quiet how snowed in i am learning peacefulness lying by myself quietly as the light lies on these white walls this bed these hands i am nobody i have nothing to do with explosions i have given my name and my day clothes up to the nurses and my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet cuff like an eye between two white lids that will not shut stupid pupil it has to take everything in the nurses pass and pass they are no trouble they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps doing things with their hands one just the same as another so it is impossible to tell how many there are my body is a pebble to them they tend it as water tends to the pebbles it must run over smoothing them gently they bring me numbness in their bright needles they bring me sleep now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage —— my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox my husband and child smiling out of the family photo their smiles catch onto my skin little smiling hooks i have let things slip a thirty year old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations scared and bare on the green plastic pillowed trolley i watched my teaset my bureaus of linen my books sink out of sight and the water went over my head i am a nun now i have never been so pure i did not want any flowers i only wanted to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty how free it is you have no idea how free —— the peacefulness is so big it dazes you and it asks nothing a name tag a few trinkets it is what the dead close on finally i imagine them shutting their mouths on it like a communion tablet the tulips are too red in the first place they hurt me even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe lightly through their white swaddlings like an awful baby their redness talks to my wound it corresponds they are subtle they seem to float though they weigh me down upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck nobody watched me before now i am watched the tulips turn to me and the window behind me where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins and i see myself flat ridiculous a cut paper shadow between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips and i have no face i have wanted to efface myself the vivid tulips eat my oxygen before they came the air was calm enough coming and going breath by breath without any fuss then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river snags and eddies round a sunken rust red engine they concentrate my attention that was happy playing and resting without committing itself the walls also seem to be warming themselves the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat and i am aware of my heart it opens and closes its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me the water i taste is warm and salty like the sea and comes from a country far away as health', \"['poem0', 'poem1', 'poem2', 'poem3', 'poem4', 'poem5', 'poem6', 'poem7', 'poem8', 'poem9']\"]\n"

dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day s caravan spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future but for the moment s whim joy freed from the bond of earth s slumber rushes into numberless leaves and dances in the air for a day my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time s waves when my works havy with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance and tmostfore you may remember them leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden but keep my song april like a child writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers wipes them away and forgets memory the priestess kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated in the mountain stillness surges up to explore its own height in the lake movement stands still to contemplate its own depth the departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket s chirp bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible tmost smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine flower have pity for the worm it is not a bee its love is a blunder and a burden with the ruins of terror s triumph children build their doll s house the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well wisher we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live your careless gifts of a moment like the meteors of an autumn night catch fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth tmost to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for tmost it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee tmost is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is tmost to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person tmost are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and tmostfore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open wmost thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gatmostd and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from wmost i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and tmostfore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change\n",

offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth tmost to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for tmost it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee tmost is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is tmost to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person tmost are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and tmostfore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open wmost thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gatmostd and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from wmost i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and tmostfore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change', 'you say that father write a lot of books but what he writes i do not understand he was reading to you all evening but could you really make out what he meant what nice stores mother you can tell us why cannot father write like that i wonder did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses has he forgotten them all often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times you wait and keep his dishes warm for him but he goes on writing and forgets father always plays at making books if ever i go to play in father s room you come and call me what a naughty child if i make the slightest noise you say do not you see that father s at his work what is the fun of always writing and writing when i take up father s pen or pencil and write upon his book just as he does a b c d e f g h i why do you get cross with me then mother you never say a word when father writes when my father wastes such heaps of paper mother you do not seem to mind at all but if i take only one sheet to make a boat with you say child how troublesome you are what do you think of father s spoiling sheets and sheets of paper with black marks all over both sides this poem is from the crescent moon by tagore', 'i wonder if i know him in whose speech is my voice in whose movement is my being whose skill is in my lines whose melody is in my songs in joy and sorrow i thought he was chained within me contained by tears and laughter work and play i thought he was my very self coming to an end with my death why then in a flood of joy do i feel him in the sight and touch of my beloved this i beyond self i found on the shores of the shining sea tmostfore i know this i is not imprisoned within my bounds losing myself i find him beyond the borders of time and space through the ages i come to know his shining self in the life of the seeker in the voice of the poet from the dark clouds pour the rains i sit and think bearing so many forms so many names i come down crossing the threshold of countless births and deaths the supreme undivided complete in himself embracing past and present dwells in man within him i shall find myself the i that reaches everywmost', 'art thou abroad on this stormy night on thy journey of love my friend the sky groans like one in despair i have no sleep tonight ever and again i open my door and look out on the darkness my friend i can see nothing before me i wonder wmost lies thy path by what dim shore of the ink black river by what far edge of the frowning forest through what mazy depth of gloom art thou threading thy course to come to me my friend', 'wmost are those tears in your eyes my child how horrid of them to be always scolding you for nothing you have stained your fingers and face with ink while writing is that why they call you dirty o fie would they dare to call the full moon dirty because it has smudged its face with ink for every little trifle they blame you my child they are ready to find fault for nothing you tore your clothes while playing is that why they call you untidy o fie what would they call an autumn morning that smiles through its ragged clouds take no heed of what they say to you my child they make a long list of your misdeeds everybody knows how you love sweet things is that why they call you greedy o fie what then would they call us who love you', 'time is endless in thy hands my lord tmost is none to count thy minutes days and nights pass and ages bloom and fade like flowers thou knowest how to wait thy centuries follow each other perfecting a small wild flower we have no time to lose and having no time we must scramble for a chance we are too poor to be late and thus it is that time goes by while i give it to every querulous man who claims it and thine altar is empty of all offerings to the last at the end of the day i hasten in fear lest thy gate be shut but i find that yet tmost is time', 'i am restless i am athirst for far away things my soul goes out in a longing to touch the skirt of the dim distance o great beyond o the keen call of thy flute i forget i ever forget that i have no wings to fly that i am bound in this spot evermore i am eager and wakeful i am a stranger in a strange land thy breath comes to me whispering an impossible hope thy tongue is known to my heart as its very own o far to seek o the keen call of thy flute i forget i ever forget that i know not the way that i have not the winged horse i am listless i am a wanderer in my heart in the sunny haze of the languid hours what vast vision of thine takes shape in the blue of the sky o farthest end o the keen call of thy flute i forget i ever forget that the gates are shut everywmost in the house wmost i dwell alone', 'mother the folk who live up in the clouds call out to me— we play from the time we wake till the day ends we play with the golden dawn we play with the silver moon i ask but how am i to get up to you they answer come to the edge of the earth lift up your hands to the sky and you will be taken up into the clouds my mother is waiting for me at home i say how can i leave her and come then they smile and float away but i know a nicer game than that mother i shall be the cloud and you the moon i shall cover you with both my hands and our house top will be the blue sky the folk who live in the waves call out to me— we sing from morning till night on and on we travel and know not wmost we pass i ask but how am i to join you they tell me come to the edge of the shore and stand with your eyes tight shut and you will be carried out upon the waves i say my mother always wants me at home in the evening — how can i leave her and go they smile dance and pass by but i know a better game than that i will be the waves and you will be a strange shore i shall roll on and on and on and break upon your lap with laughter and no one in the world will know wmost we both are this word evening is an editing of the original post across the web it seems it was mistakenly replaced with everything but this is not the case on p 28 of tagore s own translation of his book the crescent moon child poems', \"['poem0', 'poem1', 'poem2', 'poem3', 'poem4', 'poem5', 'poem6', 'poem7', 'poem8', 'poem9']\"]\n"

remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would

pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever

touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth tmost to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for tmost it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee tmost is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is tmost to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person tmost are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and tmostfore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open wmost thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gatmostd and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from wmost i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and tmostfore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change',\n",

              "0   The womb Rattles its pod, the moon Discharges itself from the tree with nowhere to go. My landscape is a hand with no lines, The roads bunched to a knot, The knot myself, Myself the rose you acheive—- This body, This ivory Ungodly as a child's shriek. Spiderlike, I spin mirrors, Loyal to my image, Uttering nothing but blood—- Taste it, dark red!

              "2  Stasis in darkness. Then the substanceless blue Pour of tor and distances.  God's lioness, How one we grow, Pivot of heels and knees! —-The furrow  Splits and passes, sister to The brown arc Of the neck I cannot catch,  Nigger-eye Berries cast dark Hooks —-  Black sweet blood mouthfuls, Shadows. Something else  Hauls me through air —- Thighs, hair; Flakes from my heels.  White Godiva, I unpeel —- Dead hands, dead stringencies.  And now I Foam to wheat, a glitter of seas. The child's cry  Melts in the wall. And I Am the arrow,  The dew that flies, Suicidal, at one with the drive Into the red  Eye, the cauldron of morning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ...  0    \n",
              "3  Empty, I echo to the least footfall, Museum without statues, grand with pillars, porticoes, rotundas. In my courtyard a fountain leaps and sinks back into itself, Nun-hearted and blind to the world. Marble lilies Exhale their pallor like scent.  I imagine myself with a great public, Mother of a white Nike and several bald-eyed Apollos. Instead, the dead injure me with attentions, and nothing can happen. Blank-faced and mum as a nurse.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ...  0    \n",

              "5  You do not do, you do not do  Any more, black shoe  In which I have lived like a foot  For thirty years, poor and white,  Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.   Daddy, I have had to kill you.  You died before I had time—-  Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,  Ghastly statue with one gray toe  Big as a Frisco seal   And a head in the freakish Atlantic  Where it pours bean green over blue  In the waters off the beautiful Nauset.  I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ...  0    \n",
              "6  Behind him the hotdogs split and drizzled On the public grills, and the ochreous salt flats, Gas tanks, factory stacks- that landscape Of imperfections his bowels were part of- Rippled and pulsed in the glassy updraught. Sun struck the water like a damnation. No pit of shadow to crawl into, And his blood beating the old tattoo I am, I am, I am. Children Were squealing where combers broke and the spindrift Raveled wind-ripped from the crest of the wave. A mongrel working his legs to a gallop Hustled a gull flock to flap off the sandspit.  He smoldered, as if stone-deaf, blindfold, His body beached with the sea's garbage, A machine to breathe and beat forever. Flies filing in through a dead skate's eyehole Buzzed and assailed the vaulted brainchamber. The words in his book wormed off the pages. Everything glittered like blank paper.  Everything shrank in the sun's corrosive Ray but Egg Rock on the blue wastage. He heard when he walked into the water  The forgetful surf creaming on those ledges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ...  0    \n",
              "7   I have done it again.   One year in every ten   I manage it——     A sort of walking miracle, my skin   Bright as a Nazi lampshade,   My right foot     A paperweight,   My face a featureless, fine   Jew linen.     Peel off the napkin   0 my enemy.   Do I terrify?——     The nose, the eye pits, the full set of teeth?   The sour breath   Will vanish in a day.     Soon, soon the flesh   The grave cave ate will be   At home on me     And I a smiling woman.   I am only thirty.   And like the cat I have nine times to die.     This is Number Three.   What a trash   To annihilate each decade.     What a million filaments.   The peanut-crunching crowd   Shoves in to see     Them unwrap me hand and foot   The big strip tease.   Gentlemen, ladies     These are my hands   My knees.   I may be skin and bone,     Nevertheless, I am the same, identical woman.   The first time it happened I was ten.   It was an accident.     The second time I meant   To last it out and not come back at all.   I rocked shut     As a seashell.   They had to call and call   And pick the worms off me like sticky pearls.     Dying   Is an art, like everything else,   I do it exceptionally well.     I do it so it feels like hell.   I do it so it feels real.   I guess you could say I've a call.     It's easy enough to do it in a cell.   It's easy enough to do it and stay put.   It's the theatrical     Comeback in broad day   To the same place, the same face, the same brute   Amused shout:     'A miracle!'   That knocks me out.   There is a charge     For the eyeing of my scars, there is a charge   For the hearing of my heart——   It really goes.     And there is a charge, a very large charge   For a word or a touch   Or a bit of blood     Or a piece of my hair or my clothes.   So, so, Herr Doktor.   So, Herr Enemy.     I am your opus,   I am your valuable,   The pure gold baby     That melts to a shriek.   I turn and burn.   Do not think I underestimate your great concern.     Ash, ash —-   You poke and stir.   Flesh, bone, there is nothing there——     A cake of soap,   A wedding ring,   A gold filling.     Herr God, Herr Lucifer   Beware   Beware.     Out of the ash   I rise with my red hair   And I eat men like air.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ...  3    \n",
              "8  On this bald hill the new year hones its edge.Faceless and pale as chinaThe round sky goes on minding its business.Your absence is inconspicuous;Nobody can tell what I lack.Gulls have threaded the river's mud bed backTo this crest of grass.  Inland, they argue,Settling and stirring like blown paperOr the hands of an invalid.  The wanSun manages to strike such tin glintsFrom the linked ponds that my eyes winceAnd brim; the city melts like sugar.A crocodile of small girlsKnotting and stopping, ill-assorted, in blue uniforms,Opens to swallow me.  I'm a stone, a stick,One child drops a barrette of pink plastic;None of them seem to notice.Their shrill, gravelly gossip's funneled off.Now silence after silence offers itself.The wind stops my breath like a bandage.Southward, over Kentish Town, an ashen smudgeSwaddles roof and tree.It could be a snowfield or a cloudbank.I suppose it's pointless to think of you at all.Already your doll grip lets go.The tumulus, even at noon, guards its black shadow:You know me less constant,Ghost of a leaf, ghost of a bird.I circle the writhen trees.  I am too happy.These faithful dark-boughed cypressesBrood, rooted in their heaped losses.Your cry fades like the cry of a gnat.I lose sight of you on your blind journey,While the heath grass glitters and the spindling rivuletsUnspool and spend themselves.  My mind runs with them,Pooling in heel-prints, fumbling pebble and stem.The day empties its imagesLike a cup or a room.  The moon's crook whitens,Thin as the skin seaming a scar.Now, on the nursery wall,The blue night plants, the little pale blue hillIn your sister's birthday picture start to glow.The orange pompons, the Egyptian papyrusLight up.  Each rabbit-earedBlue shrub behind the glassExhales an indigo nimbus,A sort of cellophane balloon.The old dregs, the old difficulties take me to wife.Gulls stiffen to their chill vigil in the drafty half-light;I enter the lit house.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ...  0    \n",
              "9  The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here. Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.       ...  0    \n",

I used to pray to recover you.  Ach, du.   In the German tongue, in the Polish town  Scraped flat by the roller  Of wars, wars, wars.  But the name of the town is common.  My Polack friend   Says there are a dozen or two.  So I never could tell where you  Put your foot, your root,  I never could talk to you.  The tongue stuck in my jaw.   It stuck in a barb wire snare.  Ich, ich, ich, ich,  I could hardly speak.  I thought every German was you.  And the language obscene   An engine, an engine,  Chuffing me off like a Jew.  A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.  I began to talk like a Jew.  I think I may well be a Jew.   The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna  Are not very pure or true.  With my gypsy ancestress and my weird luck  And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack  I may be a bit of a Jew.   I have always been scared of you,  With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.  And your neat mustache  And your Aryan eye, bright blue.  Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You——   Not God but a swastika  So black no sky could squeak through.  Every woman adores a Fascist,  The boot in the face, the brute  Brute heart of a brute like you.   You stand at the blackboard, daddy,  In the picture I have of you,  A cleft in your chin instead of your foot  But no less a devil for that, no not  Any less the black man who   Bit my pretty red heart in two.  I was ten when they buried you.  At twenty I tried to die  And get back, back, back to you.  I thought even the bones would do.   But they pulled me out of the sack,  And they stuck me together with glue.  And then I knew what to do.  I made a model of you,  A man in black with a Meinkampf look   And a love of the rack and the screw.  And I said I do, I do.  So daddy, I'm finally through.  The black telephone's off at the root,  The voices just can't worm through.   If I've killed one man, I've killed two—-  The vampire who said he was you  And drank my blood for a year,  Seven years, if you want to know.  Daddy, you can lie back now.   There's a stake in your fat black heart  And the villagers never liked you.  They are dancing and stamping on you.  They always knew it was you.  Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.</td>\n",

Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands. I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions. I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses And my history to the anaesthetist and my body to surgeons.  They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut. Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in. The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, So it is impossible to tell how many there are.  My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently. They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep. Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage —— My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, My husband and child smiling out of the family photo; Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.  I have let things slip, a thirty-year-old cargo boat Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address. They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations. Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head. I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.  I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty. How free it is, you have no idea how free —— The peacefulness is so big it dazes you, And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets. It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.  The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me. Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby. Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds. They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down, Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their colour, A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.  Nobody watched me before, now I am watched. The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself. The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.  Before they came the air was calm enough, Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss. Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise. Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine. They concentrate my attention, that was happy Playing and resting without committing itself.  The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves. The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat, And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me. The water I taste is warm and salty, like the sea, And comes from a country far away as health.</td>\n",

The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.      But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.      It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.      There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.

              "      <td>My fancies are fireflies, —  Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.  he voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.  In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.</td>\n",

What nice stores, mother, you can tell us! Why can't father write like that, I wonder?      Did he never hear from his own mother stories of giants and fairies and princesses?      Has he forgotten them all?      Often when he gets late for his bath you have to call him a hundred times.      You wait and keep his dishes warm for him, but he goes on writing and forgets.      Father always plays at making books.      If ever I go to play in father's room, you come and call me, \"What a naughty child!\"      If I make the slightest noise you say, \"Don't you see that father's at his work?\"      What's the fun of always writing and writing?

When my father wastes such heaps of paper, mother, you don't seem to mind at all.

The queen lives in a palace with seven courtyards, and she wears a jewel that cost all the wealth of seven kingdoms.      But let me tell you, mother, in a whisper, where my king's palace is.      It is at the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      The princess lies sleeping on the far-away shore of the seven impassable seas.      There is none in the world who can find her but myself.      She has bracelets on her arms and pearl drops in her ears; her hair sweeps down upon the floor.      She will wake when I touch her with my magic wand and jewels will fall from her lips when she smiles.      But let me whisper in your ear, mother; she is there in the corner of our terrace where the pot of the tulsi plant stands.      When it is time for you to go to the river for your bath, step up to that terrace on the roof.      I sit in the corner where the shadow of the walls meet together.      Only puss is allowed to come with me, for she know where the barber in the story lives.      But let me whisper, mother, in your ear where the barber in the story lives.

              "      <td>My fancies are fireflies, —  Specks of living light twinkling in the dark.  he voice of wayside pansies, that do not attract the careless glance, murmurs in these desultory lines.  In the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day's caravan.  Spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future, but for the moment's whim.  Joy freed from the bond of earth's slumber rushes into numberless leaves, and dances in the air for a day.  My words that are slight my lightly dance upon time's waves when my works havy with import have gone down.  Mind's underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky.  The butterfly counts not months but moments, and has time enough.  My thoughts, like spark, ride on winged surprises, carrying a single laughter. The tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp.  Let my love, like sunlight, surround you and yet give you illumined freedom.  Days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night.  My offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance, and therefore you may remember them.  Leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden, but keep my song.  April, like a child, writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers, wipes them away and forgets.  Memory, the priestess, kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past.  From the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust, God watches them play and forgets the priest.  My mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated.  In the mountain, stillness surges up to explore its own height; in the lake, movement stands still to contemplate its own depth.  The departing night's one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn.  Maiden, thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature, tense with an unyielding secret.  Sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket's chirp.  Bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it. Wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars.  Though he holds in his arms the earth-bride, the sky is ever immensely away.  God seeks comrades and claims love, the Devil seeks slaves and claims obedience.  The soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her, the sky asks nothing and leaves it free.  Jewel-like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment.  The child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time, unobscured by the dust of history.  Alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time.  One who was distant came near to me in the morning, and still nearer when taken away by night.  White and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects.  When peace is active swepping its dirt, it is storm.  The lake lies low by the hill, a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible.  There smiles the Divine Child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows.  The breeze whispers to the lotus, \"What is thy secret?\" \"It is myself,\" says the lotus, \"Steal it and I disappear!\"  The freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches.  The jasmine's lisping of love to the sun is her flowers.  The tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself.  Gods, tired of their paradise, envy man.  Clouds are hills in vapour, hills are clouds in stone, — a phantasy in time's dream.  While God waits for His temple to be built of love, men bring stones.  I touch God in my song as the hill touches the far-away sea with its waterfall.  Light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds.  My heart to-day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun  after the rain is over.  I have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul, but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green.  The one without second is emptiness, the other one makes it true.  Life's errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole.  They expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure.  In love I pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art.  The pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies, and the sun says, they are good.  Your calumny against the great is impious, it hurts yourself; against the small it is mean, for it hurts the victim.  The first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song.  Dawn—the many-coloured flower—fades, and then the simple light-fruit, the sun appears.  The muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry.  The wind tries to take the flame by storm  only to blow it out.  Life's play is swift, Life's playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten.  My flower, seek not thy paradise in a fool's buttonhole.  Thou hast risen late, my crescent moon, but my night bird is still awake to greet thee.  Darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom.  Trees are the earth's endless effort to speak to the listening heaven.  The burden of self is lightened when I laugh at myself.  The weak can be terrible  because they try furiously to appear strong.  The wind of heaven blows, The anchor desperately clutches the mud, and my boat is beating its breast against the chain.  The spirit of death is one, the spirit of life is many, Whe God is dead religion becomes one.  The blue of the sky longs for the earth's green, the wind between them sighs, \"Alas.\" Day's pain muffled by its own glare, burns among stars in the night.  The stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched.  The cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile.  He who does good comes to the temple gate, he who loves reaches the shrine.  Flower, have pity for the worm, it is not a bee, its love is a blunder and a burden.  With the ruins of terror's triumph children build their doll's house.  The lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame's kiss in the night.  Feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky.  The flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous.  The world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well-wisher.  We gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live.  Your careless gifts of a moment, like the meteors of an autumn night, catch fire in the depth of my being.  The faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once.  Spring hesitates at winter's door, but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom.  The world is the ever-changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence.  The two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears.  As a river in the sea, work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure.  I lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom, but the azalea brins to me, my love, thy forgiveness.  Thy shy little pomegranate bud, blushing to-day behind her veil, will burst into a passionate flower to-morrow when I am away.  The clumsiness of power spoils the key, and uses the pickaxe.  Birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day.  These paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours, and not to reach any destination.  Migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love.  The sea of danger, doubt and denial around man's little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown.  Love punishes when it forgives, and injured beauty by its awful silence.  You live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth.  The same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns.  God is world is ever renewed by death, a Titan's ever crushed by its own existence.  The glow-worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky.  The tree is of to-day, the flower is old, it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed.  Each rose that comes brings me greetings from the Rose of an eternal spring. God honours me when I work, He loves me when I sing.  My love of to-day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday's love.  The fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow.  The grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths.  Thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky, an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows.  In pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf.  The shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence, Flowers guess the secret, and mile, while the leaves whisper.  I leave no trace of wings in the air, but I am glad I have had my flight.  The fireflies, twinkling among leaves, make the stars wonder.  The mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist.  While the rose said to the sun, \"I shall ever remember thee,\" her petals fell to the dust.  Hills are the earth's gesture of despair for the unreachable.  Though the thorn in thy flower pricked me, O Beauty, I am grateful.  The world knows that the few are more than the many.  Let not my love be a burden on you, my friend, know that it pays itself.  Dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness, and is content to vanish when the sun comes out.  Beauty is truth's smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror.  The dew-drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb.  Forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages, swarming in the air, hum round my heart and seek my voice.  The desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness.  In the thrill of little leaves I see the air's invisible dance, and in their glimmering the secret heart-beats of the sky.  You are like a flowering tree, amazed when I praise you for your gifts.  The earth's sacrifical fire flames up in her trees, scattering sparks in flowers.  Foretsts, the clouds of earth, hold up to the sky their silence, and clouds from above come down in resonant showers.  The world speaks to me in pictures, my soul answers in music.  The sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun.  The darkness of night, like pain, is dumb, the darkness of dawn, like peace, is silent.  Pride engraves his frowns in stones, loe offers her surrender in flowers.  The obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow.  The hill in its longing for the far-away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking.  To justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night.  Profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable.  In its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea, and laughs and bursts into emptiness.  Love is an endless mystery, for it has nothing else to explain its.  My clouds, sorrowing in the dark, forget that they themselves have hidden the sun.  Man discovers his own wealth when God comes to ask gifts of him.  You leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation.  I came to offer thee a flower, but thou must have all my garden,— It is thine.  The picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow.  It is easy to make faces at the sun, He is exposed by his own light in all directions.  History slowly smothers its truth, but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain.  My work is rewarded in daily wages, I wait for my final value in love.  Beauty knows to say, \"Enough,\" barbarism clamours for still more.  God loves to see in me, not his servant, but himself who serves all.  The darkness of night is in harmony with day, the morning of mist is discordant.  In the bounteous time of roses love is wine,— it is food in the famished hour when their petals are shed.  An unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet: \"Are we not of the same soil, my lover?\"  I am able to love my God because He gives me freedom to deny Him.  My untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame.  The worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books.  The clouded sky to-day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity.  The shade of my tree is for passers-by, its fruit for the one for whom I wait.  Flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night.  Light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation.  The reed waits for his master's breath, the Master goes seeking for his reed.  To the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal, its writing unmeaning.  The sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon.  The greed for fruit misses the flower.  God in His temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp.  The fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers. Released from bonds, the shameless flame dies in barren ashes.  The sky sets no snare to capture the moon, it is her own freedom which binds her. The light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew-drop on the grass.  Wealth is the burden of bigness, Welfare the fulness of being.  The razor-blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun.  The butterfly has leisure to love the lotus, not the bee busily storing honey.  Child, thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water, the flower's speechless secrets, the clouds' dreams, the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky.  The rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater.  The mist weaves her net round the morning, captivates him, and makes him blind.  The Morning Star whispers to Dawn, \"Tell me that you are only for me.\" \"Yes,\" she answers, \"And also only for that nameless flower.\"  The sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams.  Perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection.  Let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself.  Beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud, in the heart of a sweet incompleteness.  Your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun-flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey.  Leaves are silences around flowers which are their words.  The tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment.  My offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road, but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend.  Hour smile, my love, like the smell of a strange flower, is simple and inexplicable.  Death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim.  The sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea.  Truth loves its limits, for there it meets the beautiful.  Between the shores of Me and Thee there is the loud ocean, my own surging self, which I long to cross.  The right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy.  The rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn.  Day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life.  The wise know how to teach, the fool how to smite.  The centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles.  The judge thinks that he is just when he compares The oil of another's lamp with the light of his own.  The captive flower in the King's wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow-flower envies her.  Its store of snow is the hill's own burden, its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world.  Listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers.  Let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness.  The spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play.  To carry the burden of the insturment, count the cost of its material, and never to know that it is for music, is the tragedy of deaf life.  Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.  I bring to thee, night, my day's empty cup, to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning's festival.  The mountain fir, in its rustling, modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace.  God honoured me with his fight when I was rebellious, He ignored me when I was languid.  The sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond.  In the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words.  Let my love find its strength in the service of day, its peace in the union of night.  Life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed Light.  The stars of night are to me the memorials of my day's faded flowers.  Open thy door to that which must go, for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed.  True end is not in the reaching of the limit, but in a completion which is limitless.  The shore whispers to the sea: \"Write to me what thy waves struggle to say.\" The sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair.  Let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life's strings and make the music thine and mine.  The inner world rounded in my life like a fruit, matured in joy and sorrow, will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation.  Form is in Matter, rhythm in Force, meaning in the Person.  There are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth, I seek thy company so that I may sing.  As the tree its leaves, I shed my words on the earth, let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence.  My faith in truth, my vision of the perfect, help thee, Master, in thy creation.  All the delights that I have felt in life's fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast, in a perfect union of love.  Some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth, and they are great; I have listened to catch the music of thy play, and I am glad.  The tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed, pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown.  The lotus offers its beauty to the heaven, the grass its service to the earth.  The sun's kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem.  The flame met the earthen lamp in me, and what a great marvel of light!  Mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us.  The cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness. The rainbow calmly answered, \"I am as inevitably real as tha sun himself.\"  Let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity.  Through the silent night I hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart.  My new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old.  The earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile.  Day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight.  My mind has itstrue union with thee, O sky, at the window which is mine own, and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom.  Man claims God's flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland.  The buried city, laid bare to the sun of a new age, is ashamed that is has lost all its song.  Like my heart's pain that has long missed its meaning, the sun's rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground. Like my heart'spain at love's sudden touch, they change their veil at the spring's call and come out in the carnival of colours, in flowers and leaves.  My life's empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out.  Emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree.  The tapestry of life's story is woven with the threads of life's ties ever joining and breaking.  Those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance.  My soul to-night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity.  Pearl shells cast up by the sea on death's barren beach,— a magnificent wastefulness of creative life.  The sunlight opens for me the word's gate, love's light its terasure.  My life like the reed with ist stops, has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains.  Let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage.  Life's aspirations come in the guise of children.  The faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever.  In my life's garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored.  The fruit that I Have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted.  The jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven.  Light is young, the ancient light; shadows are of the moment, they are born old.  I feel that the ferry of my songs at the day's end will brong me across to the other shore from where I shall see.  The butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine, I lose the one that is netted by me.  Your voice, free bird, reaches my sleeping nest, and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds.  I miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because I know not of the parts that others play.  The flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit.  I leave my songs behind me  to the bloom of the ever-returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south.  Dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest.  The mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light.  The unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns, into thoughts and reams.  My songs are to sing that I have loved Thy singing.  When the voice of the Silent touches my words I know him and therefore I know myself.  My last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me.  Love's gift cannot be given, it waits to be accepted.  When death comes and whispers to me, \"Thy days are ended,\" let me say to him, \"I have lived in love and not in mere time.\" He will ask, \"Will thy songs remain?\" I shall say, \"I know not, but this I know that often when I sang I found my eternity.\"  \"Let me light my lamp,\" say the star, 'and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness.\"  Before the end of my journey may I reach within myself the one which is the all, leaving the outer shell to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change.</td>\n",

in the drowsy dark caves of the mind dreams build their nest with fragments dropped from day s caravan spring scatters the petals of flowers that are not for the fruits of the future but for the moment s whim joy freed from the bond of earth s slumber rushes into numberless leaves and dances in the air for a day my words that are slight my lightly dance upon time s waves when my works havy with import have gone down mind s underground moths grow filmy wings and take a farewell flight in the sunset sky the butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough my thoughts like spark ride on winged surprises carrying a single laughter the tree gazes in love at its own beautiful shadow which yet it never can grasp let my love like sunlight surround you and yet give you illumined freedom days are coloured vbubbles that float upon the surface of fathomless night my offerings are too timid to claim your remembrance and therefore you may remember them leave out my name from the gift if it be a burden but keep my song april like a child writes hieroglyphs on dust with flowers wipes them away and forgets memory the priestess kills the present and offers its heart to the shrine of the dead past from the solemn gloom of the temple children run out to sit in the dust god watches them play and forgets the priest my mind starts up at some flash on the flow of its thoughts like a brook at a sudden liquid note of its own that is never repeated in the mountain stillness surges up to explore its own height in the lake movement stands still to contemplate its own depth the departing night s one kiss on the closed eyes of morning glows in the star of dawn maiden thy beauty is like a fruit which is yet to mature tense with an unyielding secret sorrow that has lost its memory is like the dumb dark hours that have no bird songs but only the cricket s chirp bigotry tries to keep turth safe in its hand with a grip that kills it wishing to hearten a timid lamp great night lights all her stars though he holds in his arms the earth bride the sky is ever immensely away god seeks comrades and claims love the devil seeks slaves and claims obedience the soil in return for her service keeps the tree tied to her the sky asks nothing and leaves it free jewel like immortal does not boast of its length of years but of the scintillating point of its moment the child ever dwells in the mystery of ageless time unobscured by the dust of history alight laughter in the steps of creation carries it swiftly across time one who was distant came near to me in the morning and still nearer when taken away by night white and pink oleanders meet and make merry in different dialects when peace is active swepping its dirt it is storm the lake lies low by the hill a tearful entreaty of love at the foot of the inflexible there smiles the divine child among his playthings of unmeaning clouds and ephemeral lights and shadows the breeze whispers to the lotus what is thy secret it is myself says the lotus steal it and i disappear the freedom of the storm and the bondage of the stem join hands in the dance of swaying branches the jasmine s lisping of love to the sun is her flowers the tyrant claims freedom to kill freedom and yet to keep it for himself gods tired of their paradise envy man clouds are hills in vapour hills are clouds in stone — a phantasy in time s dream while god waits for his temple to be built of love men bring stones i touch god in my song as the hill touches the far away sea with its waterfall light finds her treasure of colours through the antagonism of clouds my heart to day smiles at its past night of tears like a wet tree glistening in the sun after the rain is over i have thanked the trees that have made my life fruitflul but have failed to remember the grass that has ever kept it green the one without second is emptiness the other one makes it true life s errors cry for the merciful beauty that can modulate their isolation into a harmony with the whole they expect thanks for the banished nest because their cage is shapely and secure in love i pay my endless debt to thee for what thou art the pond sends up its lyrics from its dark in lilies and the sun says they are good your calumny against the great is impious it hurts yourself against the small it is mean for it hurts the victim the first flower that blossomed on this earth was an invitation to the unborn song dawn—the many coloured flower—fades and then the simple light fruit the sun appears the muscle that has a doubt if its wisdom throttles the voice that would cry the wind tries to take the flame by storm only to blow it out life s play is swift life s playthings fall behind one by one and are forgotten my flower seek not thy paradise in a fool s buttonhole thou hast risen late my crescent moon but my night bird is still awake to greet thee darkness is the veiled bride silently waiting for the errant light to return to her bosom trees are the earth s endless effort to speak to the listening heaven the burden of self is lightened when i laugh at myself the weak can be terrible because they try furiously to appear strong the wind of heaven blows the anchor desperately clutches the mud and my boat is beating its breast against the chain the spirit of death is one the spirit of life is many whe god is dead religion becomes one the blue of the sky longs for the earth s green the wind between them sighs alas day s pain muffled by its own glare burns among stars in the night the stars crowd round the virgin night in silent awe at her loneliness that can never be touched the cloud gives all its gold to the departing sun and greets the rising moon with only a pale smile he who does good comes to the temple gate he who loves reaches the shrine flower have pity for the worm it is not a bee its love is a blunder and a burden with the ruins of terror s triumph children build their doll s house the lamp waits through the long day of neglect for the flame s kiss in the night feathers in the dust lying lazily content have forgotten their sky the flowers which is single need not envy the thorns that are numerous the world suffers most from the disinterested tyranny of its well wisher we gain freedom whrn we have paid the full price for our right to live your careless gifts of a moment like the meteors of an autumn night catch fire in the depth of my being the faith waiting in the heart of a seed promises a miracle of life which it cannot prove at once spring hesitates at winter s door but the mango blossom rashly runs our to him before her time and meets her doom the world is the ever changing foam thet floats on the surface of a sea of silence the two separated shores mingle their voices in a song of unfathomed tears as a river in the sea work finds its fulfilment in the depth of leisure i lingered on my way till thy cherry tree lost ist bossom but the azalea brins to me my love thy forgiveness thy shy little pomegranate bud blushing to day behind her veil will burst into a passionate flower to morrow when i am away the clumsiness of power spoils the key and uses the pickaxe birth is from the mystery of night into the grerater mystery of day these paper boats of mine are meant to dance on the ripples of hours and not to reach any destination migratory songs wing from my heart and seek their nests in your voice of love the sea of danger doubt and denial around man s little island of certainty challenges him to dare the unknown love punishes when it forgives and injured beauty by its awful silence you live alone and unrecompensed because they are afraid of your great worth the same sun is newly born in new lands in a ring of endless dawns god is world is ever renewed by death a titan s ever crushed by its own existence the glow worm while exploring the dust never knows that stars are in the sky the tree is of to day the flower is old it brings with it the message of the immemorial seed each rose that comes brings me greetings from the rose of an eternal spring god honours me when i work he loves me when i sing my love of to day finds no home in the nest deserted by yesterday s love the fire of pain tracse for my soul a luminous path across her sorrow the grass survives the hill through its resurrections from countless deaths thou hast vanished from my reach leaving an impalpable touch in the blue of the sky an invisible image in the wind moving among the shadows in pity for the desolate branch spring leaves to it a kiss that fluttered in a lonely leaf the shy shadow in the farden loves the sun in silence flowers guess the secret and mile while the leaves whisper i leave no trace of wings in the air but i am glad i have had my flight the fireflies twinkling among leaves make the stars wonder the mountain remains unmoved at its seeming defeat by the mist while the rose said to the sun i shall ever remember thee her petals fell to the dust hills are the earth s gesture of despair for the unreachable though the thorn in thy flower pricked me o beauty i am grateful the world knows that the few are more than the many let not my love be a burden on you my friend know that it pays itself dawn plays her lute before the gate of darkness and is content to vanish when the sun comes out beauty is truth s smile when she beholds her own face in a perfect mirror the dew drop knows the sun only within its own tiny orb forlorn thoughts from the forsaken hives of all ages swarming in the air hum round my heart and seek my voice the desert is imprisoned in the wall of its unbounded barrenness in the thrill of little leaves i see the air s invisible dance and in their glimmering the secret heart beats of the sky you are like a flowering tree amazed when i praise you for your gifts the earth s sacrifical fire flames up in her trees scattering sparks in flowers foretsts the clouds of earth hold up to the sky their silence and clouds from above come down in resonant showers the world speaks to me in pictures my soul answers in music the sky tells its beads all night on the countless stars in memory of the sun the darkness of night like pain is dumb the darkness of dawn like peace is silent pride engraves his frowns in stones loe offers her surrender in flowers the obsequious brush curtails truth in diference to the canvas which is narrow the hill in its longing for the far away sky wishes to be like the cloud with its endless urge of seeking to justify their own spilling of ink they spell the day as night profit smiles on goodness when the good is profitable in its swelling pride the bubble doubts the turth of the sea and laughs and bursts into emptiness love is an endless mystery for it has nothing else to explain its my clouds sorrowing in the dark forget that they themselves have hidden the sun man discovers his own wealth when god comes to ask gifts of him you leave your memory as a flame to my lonely lamp of separation i came to offer thee a flower but thou must have all my garden — it is thine the picture—a memory of light treasured by the shadow it is easy to make faces at the sun he is exposed by his own light in all directions history slowly smothers its truth but hastily struggles to revive it in the terrible penance of pain my work is rewarded in daily wages i wait for my final value in love beauty knows to say enough barbarism clamours for still more god loves to see in me not his servant but himself who serves all the darkness of night is in harmony with day the morning of mist is discordant in the bounteous time of roses love is wine — it is food in the famished hour when their petals are she would an unknown flower in a strange land speaks to the poet are we not of the same soil my lover i am able to love my god because he gives me freedom to deny him my untuned strings beg for music in their anguished cry of shame the worm thinks it strange and foolish that man does not eat his books the clouded sky to day bears the visior of the shadow of a divine sadness on the forehead of brooding eternity the shade of my tree is for passers by its fruit for the one for whom i wait flushed with the glow of sunset earth seems like a ripe fruit ready to be harvested by night light accepts darkness for his spouse for the sake of creation the reed waits for his master s breath the master goes seeking for his reed to the blind pen the hand that writes is unreal its writing unmeaning the sea smites his own barren breast because he has no flowers to offer to the moon the greed for fruit misses the flower god in his temple of stars waits for man to bring him his lamp the fire restrained in the tree fashions flowers released from bonds the shameless flame dies in barren ashes the sky sets no snare to capture the moon it is her own freedom which binds her the light that fills the sky seeks its limit in a dew drop on the grass wealth is the burden of bigness welfare the fulness of being the razor blade is proud of its keenness when it sneers at the sun the butterfly has leisure to love the lotus not the bee busily storing honey child thou bringest to my heart the babble of the wind and the water the flower s speechless secrets the clouds dreams the mute gaze of wonder of the morning sky the rainbow among the clouds may be great but the little butterfly among the bushes is greater the mist weaves her net round the morning captivates him and makes him blind the morning star whispers to dawn tell me that you are only for me yes she answers and also only for that nameless flower the sky remains infinitely vacant for earth there to build its heaven with dreams perhaps the crescent moon smiles in doubt at being told that it is a fragment awaiting perfection let the evening forgive the mistakes of the day and thus win peace for herself beauty smiles in the confinement of the bud in the heart of a sweet incompleteness your flitting love lightly brushed with its wings my sun flower and never asked if it was ready to surrender its honey leaves are silences around flowers which are their words the tree bears its thousand years as one large majestic moment my offerings are not for the temple at the end of the road but for the wayside shrines that surprise me at every bend hour smile my love like the smell of a strange flower is simple and inexplicable death laughs when the merit of the dead is exaggerated for it swells his store with more than he can claim the sigh of the shore follows in vain the breeze that hastens the ship across the sea truth loves its limits for there it meets the beautiful between the shores of me and thee there is the loud ocean my own surging self which i long to cross the right to possess boasts foolishly of its right to enjoy the rose is a great deal more than a blushing apology for the thorn day offers to the silence of stars his golden lute to be tuned for the endless life the wise know how to teach the fool how to smite the centre is still and silent in the heart of an enternal dance of circles the judge thinks that he is just when he compares the oil of another s lamp with the light of his own the captive flower in the king s wreath smiles bitterly when the meadow flower envies her its store of snow is the hill s own burden its outpouring if streams is borne by all the world listen to the prayer of the forest for its freedom in flowers let your love see me even through the barrier of nearness the spirit of work in creation is there to carry and help the spirit of play to carry the burden of the insturment count the cost of its material and never to know that it is for music is the tragedy of deaf life faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark i bring to thee night my day s empty cup to be cleansed with thy cool darkness for a new morning s festival the mountain fir in its rustling modulates the memory of its fights with the storm into a hymn of peace god honoured me with his fight when i was rebellious he ignored me when i was languid the sectarina thinks that he has the sea ladled into his private pond in the shady depth of life are the lonely nests of memories that shrink from words let my love find its strength in the service of day its peace in the union of night life sends up in blades of grass its silent hymn of praise to the unnamed light the stars of night are to me the memorials of my day s faded flowers open thy door to that which must go for the loss becomes unseemly when obstructed true end is not in the reaching of the limit but in a completion which is limitless the shore whispers to the sea write to me what thy waves struggle to say the sea writes in foam again and again and wipes off the lines in a boisterous despair let the touch ofthy finger thrill my life s strings and make the music thine and mine the inner world rounded in my life like a fruit matured in joy and sorrow will drop into the darkness of the orogonal soil for some further course of creation form is in matter rhythm in force meaning in the person there are seekers of wisdom and seekers of wealth i seek thy company so that i may sing as the tree its leaves i she would my words on the earth let my thoughts unuttered flower in thy silence my faith in truth my vision of the perfect help thee master in thy creation all the delights that i have felt in life s fruits and flowers let me offer to thee at the end of the feast in a perfect union of love some have thought deeply and explored the meaning of thy truth and they are great i have listened to catch the music of thy play and i am glad the tree is a winged spirit released from the bondage of seed pursuing its adventure of life across the unknown the lotus offers its beauty to the heaven the grass its service to the earth the sun s kiss mellows into abandonment the miserliness of the green fruit clinging to its stem the flame met the earthen lamp in me and what a great marvel of light mistakes live in the neighbourhood of truth and therefore delude us the cloud laughed at the rainbow saying that is was an upstart gaudy in its emptiness the rainbow calmly answered i am as inevitably real as tha sun himself let me not grope in vain in the dark but keep my mind still in the faith that the day will break and truth will appear in its simplicity through the silent night i hear the returning vagrant hopes of the morning knock at my heart my new love comes bringing to me the eternal wealth of the old the earth gazes at the moon and wonders that she sould have all her music in her smile day with its glare of curiosity puts the stars to flight my mind has itstrue union with thee o sky at the window which is mine own and not in the open where thou hast thy sole kingdom man claims god s flowers as his own when he weaves them in a garland the buried city laid bare to the sun of a new age is ashamed that is has lost all its song like my heart s pain that has long missed its meaning the sun s rays robed in dark hide themselves under the ground like my heart spain at love s sudden touch they change their veil at the spring s call and come out in the carnival of colours in flowers and leaves my life s empty flute waits for its final music like the primal darkness before the stars came out emancipation from the bondage of the soil is no freedom for the tree the tapestry of life s story is woven with the threads of life s ties ever joining and breaking those thoughts of mine that are never captured by words perch upon my song and dance my soul to night loses itself in the silent heart of a tree standing alone among the whispers of immensity pearl shells cast up by the sea on death s barren beach — a magnificent wastefulness of creative life the sunlight opens for me the word s gate love s light its terasure my life like the reed with ist stops has its play od colours through the gaps in its hopes and gains let not my thanks to thee rob my silence of its fuller homage life s aspirations come in the guise of children the faded flower sighs that the spring has vanished for ever in my life s garden my wealth has been of the shadows and lights that are never gathered and stored the fruit that i have gained for ever is thet which thou hast accepted the jasmine knows the sun to be her brother in the heaven light is young the ancient light shadows are of the moment they are born old i feel that the ferry of my songs at the day s end will brong me across to the other shore from where i shall see the butterfly flitting from flower to flower ever remains mine i lose the one that is netted by me your voice free bird reaches my sleeping nest and my drowsy wings dream of a voyage to the light above the clouds i miss the meaning of my own part in the play of life because i know not of the parts that others play the flower sheds all its petals and finds the fruit i leave my songs behind me to the bloom of the ever returning honeysuckles and the joy of the wind from the south dead leaves when they lose themselves in soil take part in the life of the forest the mind ever seeks its words from its sounds and silence as the sky from its darkness and light the unseen dark plays on his flute and the rhythm of light eddies into stars and suns into thoughts and reams my songs are to sing that i have loved thy singing when the voice of the silent touches my words i know him and therefore i know myself my last salutations are to them who knew me imperfect and loved me love s gift cannot be given it waits to be accepted when death comes and whispers to me thy days are ended let me say to him i have lived in love and not in mere time he will ask will thy songs remain i shall say i know not but this i know that often when i sang i found my eternity let me light my lamp say the star and never debate if it will help to remove the darkness before the end of my journey may i reach within myself the one which is the all leaving the outer she will to float away with the drifting multitude upon the current of chance and change',\n",

              "'[With celebrations about to begin to mark 75 years of political freedom from the colonial yoke, it is time to revisit the makers of India’s intellectual life in modern times. It’s also time to rekindle the debate on the links between political and intellectual freedoms. Unlike European countries, from where we have borrowed the concept of a nation, India’s strength lies in its diversity of different cultures, castes, religions, languages. In Australia and America, colonisers forcefully brought in oneness by almost totally exterminating the native population. In contrast, India has a unique history of tolerance for whoever wished to make it their home. Therefore, aggressive nationalism goes against the idea of India – it is highly impractical as well., One prominent public intellectual who had — and still has — enormous influence on the Indian way of thinking is Rabindranath Tagore. In the run-up to Independence Day, it would be appropriate to revisit his idea of a free nation, presented in his poem, ‘Where the mind is without fear…’. This poem was published in 1910, as a part of the collection, Gitanjali. Although these lines were written much before India got political freedom, it seems we still haven’t grasped Tagore’s concept of independence, a century after their publication., Tagore’s holistic vision of a nation seems utopian through the lens of contemporary nationalism. However, it remains salient at a time when the concept of global community is becoming embattled – while the need for such bonds has never been more important., Tagore says that the citizens of a truly free nation would live without any fear of other individuals and of the establishment bulldozing their rights or hurting their dignity. When the mind is filled with constant fear of the unknown, then the higher possibilities of human life can’t be achieved. A fearless mind is a basic necessity that a free nation must give its citizens., The next important quality of a free nation in Tagore’s vision is “self-respect” — that citizens won’t have to bow down to the whims of the powerful. A free nation doesn’t discriminate amongst its citizens or hold them hostage to caste, class, gender, language or religious differences., Most importantly, a free nation provides knowledge, free of cost to all its citizens. Though successive governments in independent India have made primary education free, they have paid little attention to the quality of education — private players who prospered in the education sector too have rarely been equal to this task. Tagore envisions a free country where education is a basic human right, provided by the state, free of cost and without any discriminations., Next, Tagore shares his views on “unity in diversity’, which is the true essence of the culture of this soil. He doesn’t want India to be broken into fragments and divided by thick walls built in the name of caste, religion, race or language. Unfortunately, the poet’s fears have come true., Tagore cautioned people against building an easy life on the foundation of lies — our words, he says, should come from the depth of truth. The dishonest shouldn’t make their way to public platforms or receive any recognition., Tagore sums up his philosophy of life with these lines: “Tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection”. According to him, constantly reforming oneself to evolve as one’s better self, is the ultimate pursuit of human existence. Interestingly, Tagore also believed that the quest for perfection is a never-ending one.]'"

              "\"[BANGALORE : October 27th is the 82nd birth anniversary of Sylvia Plath, one of the most important female poets and writers of the 20th century. Her life has been variously celebrated and appropriated by feminist academics, ordinary American housewives and successive generations of students and aspiring poets. Her poetry and fiction drawn from her personal life and experiences, left an indelible impression on the history of modern English literature. , Most discussions and debates around Plath's work touch upon her history and struggle with depression as well as her suicide at the young age of 30. It is this fact combined with Sylvia Plath's turbulent marriage to poet Ted Hughes, her own almost therapeutic examination of her mental state through her writing, her very public attempts to exorcise her personal demons and literary as well as real exploration of the ideas of mortality and suicide (Plath tried to kill herself on numerous occasions), that led to her posthumous reimagining as a Greek tragic heroine, 'a feminist martyr' and an all-round 'Queen of Sorrows' who died at her creative zenith. , However, Plath's legacy lies in the often gut-wrenching, stark and raw appeal of her writing more than the circumstances of her death., If anything her early demise only heightened the tragedy of an unfulfilled creative life that promised far greater height than what she had already scaled. , Her innate poetic talent, her elemental imagery, her rich inner life and her ability to explore all that lay at the hidden edges of a woman's mind and body made her a literary icon for all time.\\xa0\\xa0 , Just before her death, Plath was writing prolifically and had just , published her semi-autobiographical and stirring novel The Bell Jar which was an unabashed and candid insight into the troubled mind of a young poet. , She also wrote some of her most powerful and highly regarded poems during this period, many of which were published in 1965 as the posthumous collection titled Ariel (edited and put together by Ted Hughes). The poems represent all that was prophetic, larger than life and a portent of things to come—namely the cult of Sylvia Plath that persists till this day—drawn from reality and a collective public imagination about an enigmatic young woman who took her own life at a young age and an extraordinarily gifted poet who could fashion art out of ordinary words. , In the title poem, Ariel, Sylvia bares her mind to the world, eerily foreshadowing her own end:]\""
